# Red Wine Analysis-Clustering/PCA

  1. Pre-processing 
  2.Define the number of cluster centers by showing all necessary steps/methods via manual & automated tools 
  3. K-means analysis for each k attempt 
  4. Evaluation of the produced outputs against the 12th column 
  5. Define the final “winner” cluster case and provide a brief explanation of evaluation indices 
  6. Apply a PCA for this white wine dataset. Create a new dataset with those PCs with a cumulative score > 96%, as attributes. 
  7. Apply kmeans on this new “PCA-based” dataset 
  8. Discuss the performance for this “PCA-based” dataset through the calculation of WSS, BSS, and BSS/TSS indices and compare them against the ones produced from the      previous “winner” model utilizing all attributes.
